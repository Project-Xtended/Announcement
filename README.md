**Halting of The Project-Xtended ROM:** 
-----------------------------

<b>Dear Brothers, Sisters & Well-Wishers,</b>

Hope You All Are Doing Great In Your Life and Taking Care Of Your Families As Well.
Time has come to share a few life updates of Bond (@SuperDroidBond) & His Brother Mukesh (@mukesh22584). 
As you all must have observed that development has been slow since a few weeks/months. In fact, 
since January 2022 we have been late in delivering the updates or updating sources as well so that maintainers can update their respective devices. 
Since January, both Bond & Mukesh are having Health Issues which later resulted into huge financial crisis. 
They tried increasing the work hours to increase the income but it resulted in more health & financial crisis.
Now, since March, they started having work & family issues as well because of Health & Financial Issues they have been into resulting in no time for Android Development.

I know it feels really bad especially when we have been receiving appreciation and good words from Users across devices for our hard work. 
But then appreciation doesnâ€™t help to solve real life issues. We tried our best to keep the project alive from our own pockets, investments of time, resource and money and everything that it demanded.
We truly appreciate some of the users who have donated to us throughout the Project Lifetime.
Thus, with heavy hearts, we would be halting the development of Project-Xtended until we fix our health & financial problems.

## With This, From Core Of Our Heart, We Would Like To Thank -

    * All Testers, All Devices, Who Kept on Testing & Sharing User Experiences, Logs, etc.
    * All The Users Who Have Been Sharing Feedback For Helping Us Improve
    * All Users Who Have Donated To Us & Helped in Keeping Project-Xtended Alive Till Date
    * All Developers & Maintainers Who Have Helped Us in Solving ROM Side Issues
    * All Developers of Other Projects From Whom We Kanged/Cherry-Picked Features
    * All Developers Who Tried Helping Us in Improving the Codes (Even The Rude Ones)
    * All Developers (Even The Retard & Dramatic Ones) Who Criticised Us
    * All Users & Well-Wishers Who Have Always Waited For New Version of Xtended To Come. 

## If You Ever Liked Our Work, Then Feel Free To Donate To Us on [SuperDroidBond](https://paypal.com/paypalme/SuperDroidBond) or on [mukesh22584](https://paypal.com/paypalme/mukesh22584)

## Let's hope this will be temporary and not a full stop of Xtended Development, Hope to See You All Soon!!!

Best Regards
### Team Xtended
(Bond & Mukesh)
